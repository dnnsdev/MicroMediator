# MicroMediator
Implementation of a/the mediator pattern for .net

Can be used in the same way as `IMediatR`, only thing to do is that you setup the startup in your Program/Startup.

`builder.Services.AddMicroMediator();`

And that's it. It's very *micro* and to me is more of an example of how easy this is to implement this pattern. If you wish to use it in a production scenario, do so as you wish. I will not fix your bugs.
